# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a problem-solving approach that is used to solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to form the solution to the original problem.

Approaches to DP -
* Top Down (Memoization)
* Bottom Up (Tabulation)
* Space Optimization 


## Memoization
Memoization is a technique used in computer science to improve the performance of algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. Memoization is a specific form of caching that is used to optimize recursive algorithms.

The basic idea behind memoization is to store the results of function calls in a cache or lookup table, so that when the same inputs are encountered again, the function can return the cached result instead of recomputing it. This can significantly improve the performance of algorithms that have a high degree of redundancy or overlap in their computations.
