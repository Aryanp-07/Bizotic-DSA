# Standard Template Library (STL)
Like collections exist in Java, STL exists in C++. STL is a collection of classes and functions that are used to perform common tasks. It consists of 3 parts -

* Collections - _arrays, sets, maps, vectors, etc._ 
* Iterators - 
* Data Structures - _LinkedList, Stack, Queues, etc._
