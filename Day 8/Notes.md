# Standard Template Library (STL)
STL is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.

## Iterators
Iterators in STL are -

* begin
  * cbegin - constant begin
  * rbegin - reverse begin
  * crbegin - constant reverse begin
* end
  * cend - constant end
  * rend - reverse end
  * crend - constant reverse end

## Vectors
A vector is a dynamic array that can be resized at runtime. It is a sequence container that supports random access and can store elements of different data types. Vectors can be accessed using the index operator `[]` and support various operations such as `push_back`, `pop_back`, `insert`, `erase`, etc.
